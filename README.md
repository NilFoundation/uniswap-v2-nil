## üìã Overview

This repository showcases the migration of Uniswap V2 to the =nil; We have adapted Uniswap‚Äôs core contracts ‚Äî Factory, Pair, and Router ‚Äî to work seamlessly with the unique capabilities of =nil; 
By using this example, developers can learn how to migrate dApps from Ethereum compatible networks to the =nil; and take advantage of its features, such as:
1. **Multi-Currency Support:** Learn how =nil; supports multiple currencies natively and how they replace the ERC20 standard
2. **Async/Sync Calls:** Discover how to effectively utilize async and sync messaging between shards, making the protocol both scalable and performant
3. **Load Distribution:** Understand how to distribute operations across multiple shards, enhancing parallel processing and scalability

This repository also aims to spark discussion on the potential of running DeFi protocols on sharded architectures, demonstrating their feasibility and advantages

## üéØ Usage

To help you get started quickly, we provide two demo tasks that showcase the full lifecycle from deployment to execution. These tasks cover deploying and initializing all necessary contracts, 
as well as performing operations like minting, swapping, and burning

### Demo Tasks
1. **Using Factory and Pair Contracts Only**  
   This demo handles deploying the Factory and Pair contracts and executing a complete flow of operations  
   [View the demo task](https://github.com/NilFoundation/uniswap-v2-nil/blob/main/tasks/core/demo.ts)

2. **Using Factory, Pair, and Router Contracts**  
   This demo includes an additional layer by utilizing the Router contract along with Factory and Pair 
   [View the demo-router task](https://github.com/NilFoundation/uniswap-v2-nil/blob/main/tasks/core/demo-router.ts)

### Running the Demo Tasks
1. **Compile the Project**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Run the Demo Tasks**:
   - For the core demo (Factory and Pair):
     ```bash
     npx hardhat demo --network nil
     ```
   - For the demo with Router (Factory, Pair, and Router):
     ```bash
     npx hardhat demo-router --network nil
     ```

### Manual Setup
If you prefer to run everything manually, we provide Ignition modules for each contract:

Additionally, all crucial contract methods have corresponding tasks:

Each subdirectory contains a README explaining the details of the tasks
